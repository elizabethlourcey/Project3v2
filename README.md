Authors: Chloe Miller, Luca Vega, Elizabeth Lourcey :D

Commit Note: Elizabeth did the most commits/pushes because SFML would only run effectively on her end. All three of us were in the library working on this together, so everyone contributed to the creation of project.

Run Instructions:
1. Ensure your CMake file accomodates SFML. Elizabeth's looks hairy because her computer hates her. CMake shoudl also include all files (main.cpp, both Trie files, Cells.h, and both HashTable files)
2. englishWords.txt and the 5 word search txt files should also be in the cmake-build-debug folder.

Language is C++, IDE is CLion, SFML imported from Github in CMake file
